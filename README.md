# user_basedPT
A Python development of the method proposed in the article: <br>[Alessandretti Laura, Márton Karsai, and Laetitia Gauvin. <br>
"User-based representation of time-resolved multimodal public transportation networks." <br>
Royal Society open science 3.7 (2016): 160156.<br>](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/7/160156)

The code performs the following tasks:
- Read GTFS data and represent it as a multilayer network
- Compute shortest paths between pairs of stops
- Plot 2D histograms of shortest paths time vs distance
